this is a homebrew fork of NewPipe to archive some kind of parental control:

- only videos from subscribed channels are shown in search results
- You can only subscribe to channels when you enter the correct hardcoded password '1234'

  This should act as an access control for minors, so only videos from whitelisted channels can be accessed.

Warning:
  This fork is for personal use for my kids, and not intended for public release. But of course anybody can try this app:

  The mentioned changes have been implemented in a laypersons way and come with several side effects.
