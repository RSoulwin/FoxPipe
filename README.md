this is a homebrew fork of NewPipe to archive some rudimental parental control:

- only videos from subscribed channels are shown in search results
- You can only subscribe to channels when you enter the hardcoded password '1234'

Warning:
  This fork is a private project, and actually not intended for public release. But of course anybody can try this app:

  https://github.com/malerva0/CloggedPipe/raw/dev/app/release/app-release.apk
  
  Please, dont expect any support.
  
  The mentioned changes have been implemented in a laypersons way and are almost untested and come with several side effects (comments to videos not shown,...)
